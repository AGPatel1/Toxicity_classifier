<h3>Toxicity Classifier</h3>
<p>
This Project is based on the ideas of 'Natural Language Processing'.<br>
NLP is a Deep learning based technique.<br>
In this Project i have Developed a Model that can classifiy whether a given Text Input is appropriate or not, i.e it predicts whether Text is Toxic or not.<br>
The model is basd on Bidierctional Long Short Term Memory network with Embedding Layer.<br>
I have Used Tensorflow and Gradio for this Project.
